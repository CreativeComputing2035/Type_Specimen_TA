    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the mid-1950s, the Haas typefoundry in Switzerland recognized a decrease in sales of their sans serif (“grotesk”) typefaces. Their classic designs were less favored than competitors like Berthold’s Akzidenz-Grotesk, which was especially popular in the emerging “International Style” of graphic design. President of the company, Eduard Hoffmann, saw an opportunity and commissioned former Haas salesman and designer, Max Miedinger, to design a new Haas Grotesk.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on Neue Haas Grotesk began early in the fall of 1956. Over the following months Miedinger and Hoffmann diligently exchanged drawings, proofs, and comparisons with the old grotesks. The most distinctive features of the new typeface were consistently horizontal stroke terminals, large x-height, and extremely tight spacing. These features together resulted in the typeface’s characteristically dense and vigorous texture.<br>
        
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following its debut at the “Graphic 57” trade show in June 1957, Neue Haas Grotesk was an immediate success. Adopted by many graphic designers it became a hallmark of contemporary Swiss graphic design.

To truly compete with other sans serifs in the global type market, Hoffmann knew it was important to make Neue Haas Grotesk available for machine composition. In June 1959 he made a deal with D. Stempel AG in Germany to manufacture Neue Haas Grotesk for the popular Linotype machine, making the typeface more practical to use for an even larger customer base.

        Despite its pervasiveness, a professional designer would rarely—at least for the moment—specify Arial. To professional designers, Arial is looked down on as a not-very-faithful imitation of a typeface that is no longer fashionable. It has what you might call a “low-end stigma.” The few cases that I have heard of where a designer has intentionally used Arial were because the client insisted on it. Why? The client wanted to be able to produce materials in-house that matched their corporate look and they already had Arial, because it’s included with Windows. True to its heritage, Arial gets chosen because it’s cheap, not because it’s a great typeface.</p>

                    <p>“Happiness is the consequence of personal effort. <strong>strive for it, insist upon it, and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it.</strong>,You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings. And once you have achieved a state of happiness, you must never become lax about maintaining it.<a href="#">YOU</a> You must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever, to stay afloat on top of it.”  <em>YOU NEED TO LOVE </em>
                        
                    <blockquote>“You need to learn how to select your thoughts just the same way you select your clothes every day. This is a power you can cultivate. If you want to control things in your life so bad, work on the mind. That's the only thing you should be trying to control.” </blockquote>
                    
                    “One thing I do know about intimacy is that there are certain natural laws which govern the sexual experience of two people, and that these laws cannot be budged any more than gravity can be negotiated with. To feel physically comfortable with someone else's body is not a decision you can make. It has very little to do with how two people think or act or talk or even look. The mysterious magnet is either there, buried somewhere deep behind the sternum, or it is not. When it isn't there (as I have learned in the past, with heartbreaking clarity) you can no more force it to exist than a surgeon can force a patient's body to accept a kidney from the wrong donor. My friend Annie says it all comes down to one simple question: "Do you want your belly pressed against this person's belly forever --or not?”
